Majority of our simulations fail to recover the \sgra observed variability in total flux.  In this Appendix we discuss and dismiss a few possible causes for mismatch of $\mi{3}$ metric in models and ALMA data.

  \label{fig:koral_MI}
\end{figure}

Our standard models of accretion are typically evolved for $\sim 30,000 \tg$. In Figure~\ref{fig:koral_MI} we show comparison of $\mi{3}$ distributions from typical duration simulation to the one that was evolved approximately three times longer. The distribution functions are in good agreement in terms of mean and standard deviation regardless of time interval chosen for comparison. The two models that are displayed in the figure are \kharma and \koral simulations differ in resolution of the numerical grid and initial torus size meaning that the variability mismatch is unlikely due to numerical resolution issues or initial conditions of the GRMHD simulations.

\subsection{Effects of \texorpdfstring{$\Rl$}{Rl} } %and radiative cooling}

For systems with sub-Eddington accretion rates, $\Dot{M}\ll\Dot{M}_\mathrm{Edd}$, such as \sgra, radiative processes can be neglected during fluid evolution (\citealt{2012MNRAS.426.1928D, 10.1093/mnras/stw3116, Ryan_2017}).
%and the plasma can be considered Coulomb collisionless (\citealt{Mahadevan_1997, 10.1093/mnras/stw3116, Ryan_2017}).
However, the uncertainties with electron heating and advection, and a limited understanding of the funnel region warrant a discussion of electron cooling in regions of high magnetization, and in particular, its effect on the 230\,GHz light curve variability.

The $\Rh$ prescription (Equation \ref{eq:rhigh_prescription}) has three free parameters: $\Rh$, $\Rl$ and $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$. During post-processing, the $\Rh$ parameter is generally varied while $\Rl$ and $\beta_\mathrm{crit}$ is set to unity because the Paticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations modelling turbulent dissipation or dissipation associated with magnetic reconnection suggest preferential heating of the electrons in regions of low plasma $\beta$ (\citealt{2010MNRAS.409L.104H, Rowan_2017, 10.1093/mnras/stx2530, Rowan_2019, Kawazura771, PhysRevX.10.041050, kawazura2021energy}).

We first investigate the effect of varying $\Rl$ on the 3 hour modulation index, $\mi{3}$. The $\Rl$ parameter dictates the electron temperature in these regions, that is, in the funnel. Increasing $\Rl$ mimics rapid electron cooling along the funnel.
\ckc{Do we want to keep the $\Rl$ plot?  It is skipped currently}
In Figure~\ref{fig:rlow_comparison} we show the effect of $\Rl$ on image morphology. It is evident that the emission becomes more compact and one may expect that this will suppress the variability.
We vary $\Rl$ for various set of the thermal (\kharma data sets) and calculate $\mi{3}$. In Figure~\ref{fig:mi_rlow} we show that the modulation index is weakly dependent on $\Rl$ parameter.
The average $\mi{3}$ does not match the observational values.

\end{figure*}

%\subsection{Radiative cooling}\label{app:cooling}

%Next, we also check if excess flux variability comes from an overestimate of electron temperatures in any areas where radiative cooling of the electrons may become important. We can estimate the possible effects of this change by imposing a limit on electron temperatures based on the local dynamical time, reflecting the assumption that higher-temperature electrons would cool before crossing the event horizon.
%This limit comes from comparing two timescales: the synchrotron cooling rate at high temperature,
%\begin{align}
%  \tau_\mathrm{cool} \approx \frac{3 m_e^3 c^5}{16 B^2 e^4 \Theta_e}
%\end{align}
%dependent on the electron temperature $\Theta_e$, expressed in units of the rest mass energy, and the local field strength $B$ in Gauss.
%and the the dynamical time
%\begin{align}
%  \tau_\mathrm{dyn} \approx \left( r \sin{\theta} \right)^{3/2} \frac{G M_\mathrm{BH}}{c^3}.
%\end{align}
%A set of images was produced which put a ceiling on the electron temperature $\Theta_e$, by requiring that the $\tau_\mathrm{cool} > N \cdot \tau_\mathrm{dyn}$ -- that is, assuming that electrons likely to cool on timescales shorter than $N$ dynamical times will do so. Lightcurves made using different values of this ceiling are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ceiling_lc1} and the corresponding $\mi{3}$ index is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ceiling_lc2}. Setting ceiling on electron temperature decreases the total flux but does not decrease the $\mi{3}$ to the desired value.

\subsection{Effect of self-consistent electron heating}

%The thermal models considered in Section~\ref{sec:models} assign a local electron temperature as a post-processing step based on local magnetic field strength, parameterized by plasma $\beta$ (Equation \ref{eq:rhigh_prescription}).

\citealt{10.1093/mnras/stv2084} provided a formulation to model electron thermodynamics during the fluid evolution. Numerical dissipation at grid scale sources entropy generation and is used to heat the electrons based on a microphysical, sub-grid heating prescription. Local fluid and electromagnetic variables are used to compute the electron entropy which along with the ideal gas equation of state, can be converted into a temperature ($\Theta_{e}$). This approach allows computing the electron temperature at each timestep of the simulation, and not during post-processing, as it is done in the $\Rh$ and Critical-$\beta$ prescriptions.

We consider three sub-grid heating models that prescribe the partition of dissipated energy into electrons and ions. \citealt{2010MNRAS.409L.104H} computed the ratio of ion-to-electron heating due to dissipation of Alfv\'enic turbulent cascade, while \citealt{10.1093/mnras/stx2530} and \citealt{Rowan_2017} considered magnetic reconnection as the source of energy dissipation at sub-grid scales. These studies provide an approximate fitting formula for the ion-to-electron heating rate ($Q_{i}/Q_{e}$) based on local ion-to-electron temperature ratio ($T_{i}/T_{e}$) and local magnetic field strength---parameterized by $\sigma$ or plasma $\beta$.

The GRMHD simulations considered here are a subset of the simulations analyzed in \citealt{2020MNRAS.494.4168D}. These include MAD and SANE accretion flows at spins, $\abh = 0,+1/2,+15/16$. We compute the 3 hour modulation index $\mi{3}$, over the time interval (5k-10k)$GM/c^{3}$. The average $\mi{3}$ values are comparable to similar $\Rh$ models, with SANE reconnection models exhibiting a reduced variability as compared to the corresponding turbulent heating models. However, the average $\mi{3}$ for all the models is greater than the $\mi{3}$ measured from the ALMA lightcurve on three days.

\subsection{Effects of fluid adiabatic index, \texorpdfstring{$\Gamma_\mathrm{ad}$}{Gad}}

We expect the ions and electrons in hot accretion flows to be thermally decoupled and the resulting plasma to be two-temperature \citep{1976ApJ...204..187S, Quataert_1998, 10.1093/mnras/stw3116, Ryan_2018, Chael2018}. The electrons in such flows are relativistic and can be modelled as a fluid with an adiabatic index $\Gamma_{e}=4/3$, while the ions are nonrelativistic and possess an adiabatic index, $\Gamma_{i}=5/3$.

The adiabatic index of the fluid assumes a value between $\Gamma_{e}$ and $\Gamma_{i}$ dictated by the thermodynamics of the ions and electrons (cf. Figure 4 in \citealt{10.1093/mnras/stw3116}). Since we do not model electron thermodynamics and ignore radiative effects during our fluid simulations, we consider a constant value $\Gamma_\mathrm{ad}$, and set it to 4/3 for the \textit{standard} set of simulations, ie. $\Gamma_\mathrm{ad}=\Gamma_{e}$. While this may be the case in the funnel, where the electrons are the hottest and highly relativistic; the fluid adiabatic index value away from the poles can be higher than the relativistic value.{\textcolor{red} [AC:] Two-temperature simulations can self-consistently evolve adiabatic indices of electrons and ions, and compute the net fluid adiabatic index with contributions from both species \cite{10.1093/mnras/stw3116}. These two-temperature simulations often show variation of the adiabatic index with polar angle, with the fluid energy dominated by hot electrons near the poles ($\Gamma = 4/3$) and by cooler ions and  electrons in the midplane ($\Gamma=5/3$).}

We look at the interplay between fluid adiabatic index and lightcurve variability by evaluating $\mi{3}$ for thermal, GRMHD models with a higher fluid adiabatic index. This includes MAD models with $\Gamma_\mathrm{ad}=13/9$ (see Section~\ref{app:narayan} and  \citealt{2021arXiv210812380N}) and SANE models with $\Gamma_\mathrm{ad}=5/3$. The models exhibit lightcurve variability similar to the \textit{standard} library and have an average $\mi{3}$ that is greater than the value obtained from the ALMA lightcurve.
