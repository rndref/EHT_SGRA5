\section{Variability Checks}\label{app:variability}

\note{David, Vedant to provide first draft}

The discussion section lists several possible causes for the apparently high variability of the models in comparison to the data.

Here we discuss and dismiss some of these possibilities.

1. GRMHD resolution.

discussion of varying resolution [Ben to spelunk to find a 448 down set of images]

Discussion of high resolution HAMR model.

2. Image resolution.

3. Model duration is not sufficiently long.

KORAL model analysis.

4. $\sigma_{cut}$ is overproducing variability.

5. Initial conditions are not a good model.

Comparison of Monika model initial conditions

6. Cooling filters the light curve. [Ben]

Discussion of model with $\Theta_{e,max}(r, \tau_{cool})$

7. Electron distribution function model is inadequate.

a.  Discussion of models with varying electron heating models.  Discussion of Jason's eheating models.   Forward reference to Diaz et al.  [Vedant]

b. Discussion of models with $\Rl = 10$. [Vedant]

8. The flow is actually made of helium. [George]

brief discussion, forward reference to Wong+.

9. $\gamma = 5/3$ rather than $4/3$.   [Vedant]  When $\gamma = 4/3$ the compression ratio across the shock is larger.
