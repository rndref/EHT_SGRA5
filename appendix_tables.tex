In this appendix we present the full set of constraint results in graphical form. 
%and tabular form.  The tables are available in tabular form.

%The pass-fail tables are presented below.  To assist in interpreting them a set of plots showing the pass-fail status of individual models in the standard Illinois model set are provided first.
First the EHT constraints.
