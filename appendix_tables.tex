\section{Pass/Fail Plots}\label{app:tables}

The full set of constraint results for the fiducial models is presented below in graphical form.
In each plot the green models pass the constraint or constraints for \kharma, \bhac, and \hamr version of the model, while the red models fail the constraint or constraints for \kharma, \bhac, and \hamr.
The yellow models have different results for the different codes.
Notice that \hamr models are available only for $i = 10, 50, 90$deg; at $30, 70$deg only the \kharma and \bhac models are compared.

% First the EHT constraints.
