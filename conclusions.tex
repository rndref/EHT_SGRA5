We have carried out and presented the most extensive comparison
between numerical models and observations of \sgra.
By using multiple simulation pipelines (cite PATOKA, BHAC+BOSS, ...),
we have demostrated that, given a set of boundary conditions,
numerical simulations are remarkablely predictive in averaged image
properties.
EHT's VLBI data is most constraining on the ring size width
(section~\ref{sec:mring}, see also \citealt{EHTpaperIII} and
\citealt{EHTpaperIV}), which roughly limit the inclinations and the
$\Rh$ parameter of the models.

Predictions:

- what would ngEHT see?

Future:

- polarization
