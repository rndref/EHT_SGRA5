\ckc{ck's first pass}

We have carried out and presented the most extensive comparison
between numerical models and observations of \sgra to date.
By using multiple simulation pipelines (cite PATOKA, BHAC+BOSS, ...),
we have demostrated that, given a set of boundary conditions,
numerical simulations are remarkablely predictive in averaged image
properties.
EHT's VLBI data shows a supriring low level of asymmetry in the image,
but is most constraining on the ring size and width
(section~\ref{sec:mring}, see also \citealt{EHTpaperIII} and
\citealt{EHTpaperIV}).
The EHT observations prefer edge-on retrogade and low spin SANE models
or face-on prograde models.

Predictions:

- what would ngEHT see?

Future:

- polarization
