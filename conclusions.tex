\ckc{ck's first pass}

We have carried out and presented the most extensive comparison
between numerical models and observations of \sgra to date.
By using multiple simulation pipelines (cite PATOKA, BHAC+BOSS, ...),
we have demostrated that, given a set of boundary conditions,
numerical simulations are remarkablely predictive in averaged image
properties.
This ability allows us to significantly reduce the uncertainty in the
plasma properties and infer the spacetime properties of \sgra.

EHT's VLBI data is most constraining on the ring size and width.
However, its surprisingly low-level of asymmetry makes the position
angle non-constraining.
Overview, the EHT constraints roughly reduce the dimension of the
parameter space by two, carving out a region of the parameter space
that prefers edge-on retrogade or low spin SANE models, or face-on
prograde models.
Together with multi-wavelength observations, we conclude that \sgra is
most likely a low spin prograde $\abh \sim 0.5$ MAD with mid
inclination $20\degree \lesssim i \lesssim 60\degree$.
For thermal models, \sgra is likely to have low electron temperate
with $\Rh \gtrsim 40$.
\ckc{I think it will be useful to translate $\Rh$ to actual electron
  temperature.
  I think someone good at handling GRMHD needs to do it, maybe George?
  Hector?}
For the $\kappa$ model, ...

% Future: polarization
While there are also isolated pockets in the parameter space that pass
all constraints, however, even with this extensive study, it is
difficult to draw strong conclusion about these regions.
Do these models pass all constraint by ``luck'' and are simply noise?
Or do we don't have a fine enough sampling in the parameter space to
carve out the narrow region of the parameter space?
While further expanding the simulation library would help addressing
these questions, we expect use the EHT's future results, especially
polarimetry information and observations with larger arrays and better
$u$-$v$ coverage, will resolve these ambiguity and pin point \sgra's
actual parameter space.

Although we are successful in predicting \sgra's average image
properties, the variability is a lot more challenging.

\ckc{chaotic nature, not controlled by conservation laws, missing
  plasma physics... etc} \br{maybe also mention order(s) of magnitude
  higher resolutions might be needed to capture ``variability''.}

Predictions: what would ngEHT see?
