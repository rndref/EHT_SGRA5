\ckc{ck's first pass}

We have carried out and presented the most extensive comparison
between numerical models and observations of \sgra to date.
By using multiple simulation pipelines (cite PATOKA, BHAC+BOSS, ...),
we have demostrated that, given a set of initial and boundary
conditions, numerical simulations are remarkablely predictive in the
averaged image properties.
This ability significantly narrows down the range of possible model
parameter and allows us to infer the spacetime properties of \sgra.

EHT's VLBI data is most constraining on the ring size and width.
However, its surprisingly low-level of asymmetry makes the position
angle non-constraining.
Overview, the EHT constraints roughly reduce the dimension of the
parameter space by two, carving out a region of the parameter space
that prefers edge-on retrogade or low spin prograde SANE models, or
face-on prograde models.
Together with non-EHT observations in other wavelengths, we conclude
that \sgra is most likely a low spin prograde $\abh \sim 0.5$ MAD with
intermediate inclination $20\degree \lesssim i \lesssim 60\degree$.
Using a thermal models, the accretion flow around \sgra is two
temperature, and likely to have ion-electron temperate $\Rh \gtrsim
40$.
\ckc{I think it will be useful to translate $\Rh$ to actual electron
  temperature.
  I think someone good at handling GRMHD needs to do it, maybe George?
  Hector?}
For the $\kappa$ model, ...

% Future: polarization
% Predictions: what would ngEHT see?
While there are also isolated pockets in the parameter space that pass
all constraints, however, even with this extensive study, it is
difficult to draw strong conclusion about these isolated regions.
Do these models pass all constraint by ``luck'' and are simply noise?
Or do we not have fine enough samples in the parameter space to
identify the narrow region of the parameter space?
While further expanding the simulation library would reduce model
uncertainty and help addressing these questions, we expect use the
EHT's future results, especially polarimetry information and
observations with larger arrays and better $u$-$v$ coverage, will
reduce observation uncertainty and resolve these ambiguity.

Although we are successful in predicting average image properties, the
variability is more challenging.
Since \sgra is radiative inefficient, the radiation energy budget is
insignificant to the total energy budget, making radiation sensitive
to the small details in the chaotic turbulence flow.
We also provide a few possible physical origins in
section~\ref{sec:variability} including resolutions and non-ideal
physics such as viscosity.
However, thes hypotheses can only be tested once models that
accurately predicted variability are available.
\br{maybe also mention order(s) of magnitude higher resolutions might
  be needed to capture ``variability''.}

The EHT observations, combined with multiwavelength information, are
now able to provide quantitative measurements to challenging numerical
models.
\emph{We have arrived a new era of precision black hole astrophysics.}
On the theory side, clearly one of the next major breakthroughs will
come from accurate modeling of the non-ideal MHD effects, as it will
provide the electron distribution functions from first principle, and
possible to improve our predictability of the variability.
