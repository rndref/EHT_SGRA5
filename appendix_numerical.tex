    [altex: plot GRRT flux vs SED flux at different wavelenghts.  Demostrates that we have good agreements for 230GHz.  Demostrate that NIR may require monty carlo calculations due to inverse Compton.  Demostrate some 86GHz images require larger FoV but they are ruled out anyway and would not affect the results.]
