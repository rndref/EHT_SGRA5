\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The Milky Way has a massive, compact object at its center that is most likely a supermassive black hole \citep{2019Sci...365..664D, 2019A&A...625L..10G}.
The supermassive object is surrounded by an accretion flow visible across 17 decades in frequency of electromagnetic spectrum.
Hereafter we will use \sgra to refer to the supermassive black hole candidate, accretion flow, and its emission.

\sgra is one of the most frequently observationally and theoretically studied systems.
We refer reader to \citetalias{PaperII} and \citetalias{PaperIII} of this series for a comprehensive overview of the historical and more recent observations of the source.
The main characteristics of the \sgra system is its extremely low overall luminosity with respect to the Eddington limit.
This suggests that matter falls onto \sgra central object in form of a radiatively inefficient/advection dominated accretion flow (RIAF/ADAF, \citealt{1977ApJ...214..840I,1994ApJ...428L..13N, 1995ApJ...444..231N, 1995ApJ...452..710N, 1996A&AS..120C.287N, 1998ApJ...492..554N,2014ARA&A..52..529Y}) rather than in form of a thin disk \citep{1973A&A....24..337S}.
Models of RIAF/ADAF have been constructed using semi-analytic prescriptions \citep[e.g.,][]{1995Natur.374..623N,2000ApJ...541..234O, 2009ApJ...697...45B,2011ApJ...735..110B} and using the time-dependent numerical General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{2000ApJ...528..462H, 2003ApJ...589..458D, 2003ApJ...589..444G, 2007CQGra..24S.235G, 2012ApJS..201....9F, 2014ApJ...796...22F, 2016ApJS..225...22W, 2017ApJS..231...17A, 2018JPhCS1031a2008O, 2019A&A...629A..61O, 2019ApJS..243...26P}, with the difference of outflows and relativistic jets being naturally produced in the latter.
Since nearly-flat spectrum emitted by \sgra in radio is alike radio spectra observed in jets from Active Galactic Nuclei, it has been suggested that majority of the \sgra emission could be in fact produced by a jet launched by an accreting black hole rather then only matter falling onto the black hole event horizon \citep{2000A&A...362..113F}.
% 2000A&A...362..113F,2004A&A...414..895F, 2005ApJ...635.1203M, 2013A&A...559L...3M
While the jet scenario in \sgra is further supported by time-lags observed between emission measured at multiple radio frequencies \citep{2021arXiv210713402B}, the major difficulty in attempts to determine the exact nature of \sgra radio emission is caused by an interstellar scattering screen that distorts our view of the Galactic Center up to $\lambda \sim 1\mm$ wavelengths
%\citep{2016ApJ...824...40O, 2017MNRAS.471.3563D, 2018ApJ...865..104J, 2019A&A...621A.119B}
\citep[see][and references therein]{2018ApJ...865..104J}.
The daily flaring activity of \sgra, observed at higher energies in near infra-red and x-rays \citep[e.g.,][]{2009ApJ...698..676D, 2019ApJ...886...96H}, suggests that the conditions around the supermassive black hole occasionally favor electron acceleration.

% it is not critical to cite theory work here
However, these observations do not discriminate between source models because they do not have sufficient resolution. Hence, the existing models for \sgra emission remain weakly constrained ([a few essential references]).

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a Very Long Baseline Interferometric (VLBI) experiment operating at $\lambda = 1.3\mm$ (or frequency $\nu = 230\GHz$) with resolving power sufficient to directly image the intrinsic \sgra structures in the immediate vicinity of the black hole event horizon.
%(the first proto-EHT, non-imaging detections of \sgra are reported by \citealt{2008Natur.455...78D, 2015Sci...350.1242J} and \citealt{2018ApJ...859...60L}).
In April~2017, the EHT observed \sgra among other sources (including the core of the M87 galaxy, \citetalias{M87PaperI}) and resulted the first ever horizon scale images of the source.
We report the results of these observations in \citetalias{PaperII} and \citetalias{PaperIII} and characterize the basic properties of the emission visible in the EHT images in \citetalias{PaperIV}.
The main goal of the present paper \citepalias{PaperV} is to provide the first comprehensive physical interpretation of the EHT~2017 \sgra data sets.

The paper is structured as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:models}, we begin with description of main assumptions, one-zone source models, and a standard simulation library used to model near horizon emission from the \sgra system.
Our library of theoretical models assumes that general relativity is valid and the spacetime around \sgra is described by a Kerr spacetime \citep{1963PhRvL..11..237K}.
The full discussion of \sgra observations in context of alternative theories of gravity can be found in a accompanying paper \citetalias{PaperVI}.
Our model library is based on time-dependent GRMHD simulations combined with general relativistic radiative transfer models that result in images and broadband spectra of the models.
The library's simulated images have been used in \citetalias{PaperIII} and \citetalias{PaperIV} to validate the \sgra EHT imaging and parameter estimation algorithms.
In Section~\ref{sec:observations}, we gather standard observation data sets that are used in the present work to test theoretical models of \sgra.
These data sets are comprised of a subset of EHT~2017 observations and other non-EHT historical or other data.
All future theoretical studies can use this information to test their theories.
In Section~\ref{sec:comparisons}, we describe model scoring procedures and use a large number of the source models to infer physical properties of \sgra system.
We discuss the model limitations, results in context of previous studies and outlook into future \sgra theoretical research directions in Section~\ref{sec:discussions}.
Finally, we conclude in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

This paper is supplemented with several appendices.
In Appendix~\ref{app:tables},      we summarize theoretical models used in this work in form of tables and figures.
In Appendix~\ref{app:numerical},   we discuss important numerical details of our simulations.
In Appendix~\ref{app:variability}, we discuss impact of physical effects on the variability of the models.
