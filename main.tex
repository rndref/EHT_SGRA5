% Feynman: Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can — if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong — to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.

\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we provide a first physical interpretation for the
  2017 EHT observations of \sgra.
  Our main approach is to compare resolved EHT data and unresolved
  non-EHT data to a library of time-dependent general relativistic
  magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) models, including aligned, tilted, and
  stellar wind-fed models; the library is ray-traced assuming both
  thermal and nonthermal electron distribution functions.
  We compare the models to a total of 11 constraints drawn from EHT
  1.3\mm data and observations at 3.5\mm, 2.2\um, and the x-ray.
  %Remarkably, one model passes all constraints: a thermal, prograde,
  %weakly magnetized (SANE) model at moderate inclination.
  There is no model that passes all constraints.
  However, some parameters are strongly disfavored for
  reasons that can be understood physically.
  About 15\% of models have spatial structure consistent with the EHT
  data alone, which disfavor edge-on strongly magnetized (MAD) models.
  About 3/4 of the models exhibit fluctuations in the 230\GHz light
  curve and in the visibility amplitudes that are larger than seen in
  the data; the data are quieter than the models as a group.
  We discuss several possible explanations for excess noise in the
  models and highlight the possibility that collisionless corrections
  to ideal fluid models may be responsible.
  All models with equal ion and electron temperatures fail one or more
  constraints.
  About half the models overproduce quiescent near-infrared and x-ray
  flux, underscoring the importance of continued multiwavelength
  monitoring of \sgra.
  \hyp{may be a good idea to rebase the sentences ``Remarkably, a
    small number models pass all constraints.
    These are prograde, weakly magnetized (SANE) models at moderate
    inclination.'' here?}
  Although the models are remarkably successful, this work signals the
  arrival of a new era of precision black hole astrophysics in which
  theoretical models are strongly challenged by the data.
  \michi{Not sure we can still describe the models als "remarkably successful."}
